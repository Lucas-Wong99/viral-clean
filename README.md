## Project Description
Viral Clean is an advertisment (buy/sell) website that targets the redistribution of cleaning supplies and personal hygiene items. The website promotes users to create listings for the items they want to sell, as well as to browse other people's listings. Other features of the website include filtering the listings by name, price and city and messaging between users.

Viral Clean was done as a midterm project for Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp.
